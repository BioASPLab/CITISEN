## Introduction
In this work, we present a deep-learning-based speech signal processing mobile application, termed CITISEN, which supports three functions: speech enhancement (SE), acoustic scene conversion (ASC), and model adaptation (MA). For the SE function, CITISEN could effectively reduce noise components from speech signals and accordingly enhance their clarity and intelligibility. For the ASC function, CITISEN converts the current background sound to that sounds like a different background. Finally, the MA function in CITISEN can effectively adapt SE models with few audio files when encountering unknown speaker or unseen noise types; the adapted SE model is used to carry out enhancement on the upcoming noisy utterances. Experimental results have confirmed the effectiveness of these three functions in terms of objective evaluation and subjective listening tests. The promising results reveal that the developed CITISEN mobile application can be potentially used as a front-end processor for various speech-related services, such as voice communication, assertive hearing devices, and virtual reality headsets.
